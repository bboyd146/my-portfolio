                <p>
                    My name is Bradley Boyd and I am an up and coming Software Developer. I was born and raised in
                    Houston,
                    Texas (where I currently reside). I love to eat, cook, and just have a good time with family and
                    friends. Most of my hobbies include something that has to do with food and drinks, but one of my
                    recently found hobbies is riding Motorcycles. About a few months ago, I test rode one of my
                    brother's
                    motorcycles and fell in love instantly. I bought one of my own not too long ago and plan on adding
                    to my
                    inventory as the years go by.

                    My work history doesn't include any software development, but my schooling on the other hand does.
                    I've
                    always wanted to be an Electrical Engineer, so most of my course work from senior high through
                    college
                    was geared as so. I've worked on projects building landscapes in AutoCAD, built and produced
                    movement
                    codes for small robots to perform minor tasks, and learned some basics of C++ programming language.
                    After successfully completing my term at Rice University's Online Coding Bootcamp and receiving my
                    certificate, I plan on continuing my growth in the Software development field.
